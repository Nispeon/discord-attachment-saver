# Discord.js image saver (WIP) - Made with Typescript

This project was purely made for myself, but I figured I might as well make it public in case someone ever finds it.  
I might make a better readme eventually. Either way, forks are welcome!

## What you need
- Typescript
- Nodejs
- npm

## How to use

- Rename `.env.example` into `.env`
- Create a Discord bot ([See the docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro))
- Get your Bot's Token and copy it inside your `.env`
- Run `npm install`
- Run the `Ã¬ndex.js` file inside the `src` directory with node (e.g: `node src/index.js` from the root)
- Once you've invited your bot to the desired channel, send `&saveall` and it will save every image attachment to the `assets` folder  
<br>
  By default, the bot looks searches through the last 500 messages posted, but this number can be changed by editing the limit
  of the getMessages function line 94 of [this file](https://github.com/Nispeon/discord-image-saver/blob/master/src/bot.ts).

If you plan to change the code, don't forget to run `npm run watch` to compile your typescript code into regular javascript
